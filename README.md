# QAM_RADIO
PSK/QAM GNURadio System

This system works using audio as an input to provide a crude app, transport and network layer with focus on the functionality of SNR
requirements for low error rates, PER<=10^-5, for audio streaming on consumer-level SDR devices such as the well-known HackRF One. 

- Future commits will offer phase correction of arbitrary mapping at the receiver. This already exists but needs to be incorporated.
